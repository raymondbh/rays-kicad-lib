# rays-kicad-lib
Raymond's KiCAD library of schematics symbols, PCB footprints and SPICE models (and maybe som 3D models). 

## Add path for library
To get spice models working, you need to add the path to this library in KiCAD:

Go to "Prefrences->Configure Paths" and add KICAD_RAYSLIB and the path to where you stored this library.
